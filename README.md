Welcome and thanks for stopping by ODOM!! Open Data/Open Minds (ODOM) is a program that supports people to tell local environmental and community stories through data investigations, science notebooking and civic engagement. And we are hoping you can help! </p>

## Project Overview
Open Data/Open Minds connects people to real-world data through hands-on work with paper circuitry.  

## What are we doing?
<i>Heads up! The materials shown here are about 6 months old. We'll be updating this site by 10/24/2017 with the new materials we are revealing at MozFest!</a>

Open Data/Open Minds (ODOM) supports communities  to tell the stories of their local environmental and civic concerns using science journaling, crafted visualization, and data investigation.
 
The program is composed of a series of data investigation activities that start as extremely basic and work up to more complex data investigations. Here's what the paper activity pages look like and you can find [pdfs of these and  other worksheets in this directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8MEcymBo7h8YTBCU0tQRXdjOG8?usp=sharing):

The activities are enabled by a set of hardware data collection and visualization tools, still in protytpe form. Here's what they look like  and you can find [full sized images in this directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8MEcymBo7h8RVBORmdEdFczRDA?usp=sharing):

We've run professional developments for teachers with these materials in the spring of 2017 and are refining the materials now so that we can do more of them in the summer. 

For more detail about the project, check out materials in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8MEcymBo7h8OUpHVkFBOG0xS0E?usp=sharing).

## Who are we?

The primary ODOM team is [Elisabeth Sylvan](http://lisard.com), [David Cole](http://cv2.com) and [Natalie Freed](http://nataliefreed.com). Elisabeth and David work at the nonprofit [Nexmap](http://www.nexmap.org). Natalie is a computational artist and high school teacher who develops the user interaction and hardware. Additional engineering support is by [Jie Qi](http://technolojie.com/) and the UK firm [Artists and Engineers](http://artistsandengineers.co.uk) in partnership with industrial designer, Roland Ellis. 

ODOM has received support and funding by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/), the [National Writing Project](https://www.nwp.org/), and several individual funders.

## What do we need?

We need your help getting the technology, curriculum and research in better shape!

We need data lovers, statistics gurus, learners, educators, evaluation researchers, to help with the following 

* reviewing and editing ODOM's curriculum and other educational materials
* reviewing and writing the program's research evaluation plan and tools
* evaluating and making suggestions for the technology and science behind our planned statistics and graphics generator 
* suggesting and helping us think through architectural and technical issues

## MozFest and getting involved!

We are so excited to be going to Mozfest! Join us at the there October 27-29, 2017 at Ravensbourne College, London! We'll be meeting in person to collaborate on this project and learn from each other. Read more about our session [https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2017/issues/717]! We are scheduling meetings with people ahead of time so feel free to reach out to Elisabeth beforehand either via email (lisard at gmail) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lisard).

Even if you aren't going to Mozfest, you can still get involved! <b>Check out our [issues](ISSUES.md) page for specific ways you can contribute!</b> Each issue explains where and how to make a particular contribution. Generally we ask you add comments to the issue or work on a linked Google Doc. If you don't understand what we are asking for or you want to help in other ways, get in touch with Elisabeth or [open a new issue](../../issues).
