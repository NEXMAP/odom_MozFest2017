Welcome and thanks for stopping by ODOM!! Open Data/Open Minds (ODOM) is a program that supports people to tell local environmental and community stories through data investigations, science notebooking and civic engagement. And we are hoping you can help! </p>

<p>We'll be at Mozfest 1) on Friday demoing at the Science Faire 2) with an interactive in the in the Decentralization Gallery and 3) facilitating a talk on Sunday in Decentralization from 3:15-4:15. (The guide says we go until 5:30, but that's incorrect.) </p>

## Project Overview
Open Data/Open Minds connects people to real-world data through hands-on work with paper circuitry.  

## What are we doing?
Open Data/Open Minds (ODOM) supports communities  to tell the stories of their local environmental and civic concerns using science journaling, crafted visualization, and data investigation.
 
The program is composed of a series of data investigation activities that start as extremely basic and work up to more complex data investigations. We are excited to share two new developments in our work. First that we will be bundling our activity sets to work with Chibitronics new notebook:

Here's what the paper activity pages look like and you can find [pdfs of these and  other worksheets in this directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8MEcymBo7h8YTBCU0tQRXdjOG8?usp=sharing):

We've run professional developments for teachers with these materials in the spring and summer of 2017 and are refining the materials so we can have more people. 

To get into the weeds of the materials, look in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8MEcymBo7h8OUpHVkFBOG0xS0E?usp=sharing).

## Who are we?

The primary ODOM team is [Elisabeth Sylvan](http://lisard.com), [David Cole](http://cv2.com) and [Natalie Freed](http://nataliefreed.com). Elisabeth and David work at the nonprofit [Nexmap](http://www.nexmap.org). Natalie is a computational artist and high school teacher who develops the user interaction and hardware. Additional engineering support is by [Jie Qi](http://technolojie.com/) and the UK firm [Artists and Engineers](http://artistsandengineers.co.uk) in partnership with industrial designer, Roland Ellis. 

ODOM has received support and funding by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/), the [National Writing Project](https://www.nwp.org/), and several individual funders.

## What do we need?

We need your help getting the technology, curriculum and research in better shape!

We need data lovers, statistics gurus, learners, educators, evaluation researchers, to help with the following 

* reviewing and editing ODOM's curriculum and other educational materials
* reviewing and writing the program's research evaluation plan and tools
* evaluating and making suggestions for the technology and science behind our planned statistics and graphics generator 
* suggesting and helping us think through architectural and technical issues

## MozFest and getting involved

We are so excited to be going to Mozfest! Join us at the there! Read more about our session [https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2017/issues/717]! We are scheduling meetings with people ahead of time so feel free to reach out to Elisabeth beforehand either via email (lisard at gmail) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lisard).

We'll be at Mozfest in the Decentralization Gallery and be giving a talk on Sunday in Decentralization from 3:15-4:15. (The guide says we go until 5:30, but that's incorrect.) 

Even if you aren't going to Mozfest, you can still get involved! <b>Check out our [issues](../../issues) page for specific ways you can contribute!</b> Each issue explains where and how to make a particular contribution. Generally we ask you add comments to the issue or work on a linked Google Doc. If you don't understand what we are asking for or you want to help in other ways, get in touch with Elisabeth or [open a new issue](../../issues).
